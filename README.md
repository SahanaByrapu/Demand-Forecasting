#### Demand Forecasting


Predict future demand to optimize inventory and logistics.

**Industry:** Retail, Supply Chain
**What you build:**  Predict future product demand to reduce stockouts

**Why recruiters like it:** Direct business cost savings. 

**Skills:** Time-series forecasting, Regression , data trends

**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data

**Upgrade:** Seasonality + festival impact modelling

**💼 Company:** Walmart uses ML forecasting to reduce stock-outs

**Resume Bullets:**
• Built time-series forecasting pipeline using Prophet and LSTM
• Reduced stock-out events by 22% across simulated stores

Retail needs to know how much inventory to stock
Energy companies need to predict consumption
Airlines need to predict passenger demand
Tech companies need to predict server load

**Start with Exploration:**
Look for “trends”
Look for “seasonality”=> weekly, monthly, yearly
Look for “Anamolies” => Why they occur??

**Build multiple models**
ARIMA, SARIMA,  
Use model base line like prophet
Deep learning approach like LSTM

Goal is not complexity , but the goal is comparison and reasoning.

1.Can you explain why one model outperforms the other?

2.Can you articulate trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability?

3.Can you identify where each model fails?

4.Connect your forecast to the business impact?

5.How better decisions improve cost, improve staffing decisions or prevent outrages

Retail, Supply chain, Finance, transportation teams.

6.In real time scenarios:

7.How often do you retrain it?

8.How would you trigger an alert?
